Using a tail pointer in a linked list makes it faster to add new nodes at the end. Without it, you would have to start from the head and go through every node to find the last one. With a tail pointer, you always know where the last node is, so adding to the end takes constant time instead of going through the whole list. This makes operations like adding to a queue more efficient.
